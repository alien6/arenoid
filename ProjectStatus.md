(2010-09-16) <b>New team member!</b>:<br>
We got a new team member: <b>xvilka</b>. He comes from <a href='https://new.droid-developers.org/'>https://new.droid-developers.org/</a> and got some increadible assembler skills. His admission into the team gives us new strength again, that we may soon be separated from the S-Class.<br>
At this moment our wiki grows up! The scattered information from various forums around the world come together here. But there are still some gaps.<br><br>If you want to help us, then write a comment here (if you have an idea how you could help us), then you get a permission to write to the wiki.<br><br>At the moment xvilka is working on the bootloaders. First of all, he want to modify the AMD bootloader, to boot a linux kernel. The bootloader he uses is called <a href='http://xvilka.github.com/2ndboot-ng/'>2ndboot</a>.<br><br>The project had often euphoric highlights, but this time we can really look forward to something. Xvilka, THANKS!<br>
