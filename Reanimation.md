If something goes wrong...


# "Reanimate" your phone #

Sometimes flashing goes wrong. You had the wrong length entered, the wrong file deleted, a power loss while flashing etc.

If your phone seems ruined there is a way to get it to work again.

Download <a href='http://www.megaupload.com/?d=2DFYO9KT'>this file</a> and flash it with the Flashtool (FLS Mode) following <a href='http://code.google.com/p/arenoid/wiki/FE2FLS'>this guide</a>.

If you ruined the BL1 or any other part which has to do with the flashing of the firmware (and not only with the firmware itself) than it could be that you cannot recover your phone.

If this happens the only way seems to be the LG Support and the hope that they reset your phone for you.
